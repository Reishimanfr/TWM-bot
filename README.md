<i>A Discord music bot made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Rei!</i><br>

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info

The world machine (or TWM for short) is a discord bot written in typescript using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library.<br>
My motivation behind it was that all the other music bots I used didn't really suit me, so I decided to write my own!

## Support

Message me on discord (@rei.shi) or [the support server](https://discord.gg/QGeraSWsan) and ask any question you want regarding the bot. Also be sure to check the wiki for most common topics!
