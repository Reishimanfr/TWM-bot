<i>A Discord music bot made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Rei!</i><br>

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è General info

The world machine (or TWM for short) is a open source discord bot written in typescript using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library.<br>
My motivation behind it was that all the other music bots I used didn't really suit me, so I decided to write my own!

## ‚≠ê Features
- üéµ [A very advanced music player]('fixme')
- üåü [A starboard script]('fixme')
- üëÄ [Multiple fun-to-use commands]('fixme')

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can configure my bot in multiple ways. If you're [self-hosting]() it go check out [this wiki page]() on possible options you can configure as a host.
If you just want to configure some stuff as the user of the bot, [click here]() to check the wiki page for user configuration options!<br>
